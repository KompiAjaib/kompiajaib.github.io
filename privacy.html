<b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b><br />
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 16 years old.<br />
Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 16?<br />

<b>Fair Information Practices</b><br />
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br />
<br />
<b>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</b><br />
We will notify you via email<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Within 7 business days<br />

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.<br />
<br />
