<p> A little about me is a blogger who started blogging at the end of 2017 At that time I was demanded in my work to promote my product on the internet, little by little I began to study internet marketing and search for articles on blogs about marketing. </p> <p> After various articles I read next I started to advertise my products on social media both Facebook, Instagram, and Google. At that time I was very routine advertising with social media, yes even though my budget was quite minimal at that time, Usually I spend about 1 million per month for the promotion fee. At that time I also created an online store website at easystore </p> <p> Short story of mine a few years I worked at the company, I decided to go out after a few months with me like reading about blog articles, I thought about how to make such writing on the internet? </p> <p> And then I just fad in between my new jobs, I created a blog with blogger platforms And the blogger I wrote with articles about tips on blogs, social media, and internet marketing </p> <p> Even though I am new to blogging, my blog is still active Although I rarely write and hehe </p> <p> This blog is a blog with my main blog subdomain. </p> <p> Here I started trying to make articles in English hehe </p> <p> Even though you are still learning, it doesn't hurt to keep learning </p> <p> Visit my blog at <a href="https://www.encepnurdin.id" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="www.encepnurdin.id"> www.encepnurdin.id </a> </p> <p> For business and advertising purposes, please contact me at this blog contact <p> <p> Thank you </p>
